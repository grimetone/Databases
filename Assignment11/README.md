## Assignment 11

Assignment was done in Java, you can run the assignment by running the main method in the Runner.java class. 

The only dependency required is org.json for json manipulation.

The two output files are called javaDef.txt and sqlSchema.txt

javaDef.txt - Shows the java class output from JSON

sqlSchema.txt - Shows the sql script output returned from the JSON. There were no syntax errors, however currently it won't run in mySQL unless you order the JSON objects correctly, as I haven't had time to reorder inserts so that they are generated in a correct order without giving a foreign key constraint error.
